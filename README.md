Project Description
A playful web app that gives you a random, silly response and meme image for anything you type.
You can even comment on each meme, because why not?

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have too much useful information and not enough random, pointless fun in their lives.
There’s no easy way to get a completely useless response to your input!

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a web app that takes anything you type and gives you a random, funny response and meme image.
You can even leave comments on each meme, just to make it even more pointless!
